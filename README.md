## 📖 What is OSCA?

OSCA stands for Open Stem Cell Agent. It is an intelligent software agent designed to handle many different tasks by learning and adapting. The system can change how it works depending on what you ask it to do. Think of it as a smart helper that can switch roles easily to fit your needs.

This software uses ideas from stem cells—cells that can develop into many types of other cells—to make its AI flexible. This lets OSCA handle a wide range of jobs without being limited to just one thing. It is built with a smart meta-cognitive system, meaning it can think about how it works and improve over time.

OSCA is made for use across many fields. Whether you want an AI that can assist you with writing, research, data analysis, or other tasks, OSCA adapts to meet those goals.

## ⚙ How OSCA Works

At the core, OSCA functions like a stem cell in biology. Stem cells can become many cell types based on what the body needs. OSCA mimics this by changing its AI approach depending on the task:

- It breaks down your request.
- It evaluates the best way to answer or act.
- It applies the right AI model or method.
- It checks results and readjusts if needed.

This flexible workflow allows OSCA to handle nearly any topic or job you have.
